## Description

The `filebeat` module installs and configures the [filebeat log shipper](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat) maintained by elastic.

## Setup

### What filebeat affects

By default `filebeat` adds a software repository to your system, and installs filebeat along
with required configurations.

### Upgrading to Filebeat 5.x

If you use this module on a system with filebeat 1.x installed, and you keep your current parameters
nothing will change. Setting `major_version` to '5' will modify the configuration template and update
package repositories, but won't update the package itself. To update the package set the
`package_ensure` parameter to at least 5.0.0.

Windows users should set `major_version` to 5 and update the `download_url` parameter to the correct
[download](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat).

If you're on a Debian based system, you need to make sure that the apt-transport-https package
is installed if you want this module to manage the repository for you (it does by default).

### Setup Requirements

The `filebeat` module depends on [`puppetlabs/stdlib`](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/stdlib), and on
[`puppetlabs/apt`](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apt) on Debian based systems.

### Beginning with filebeat

`filebeat` can be installed with `puppet module install pcfens-filebeat` (or with r10k, librarian-puppet, etc.)

The only required parameter, other than which files to ship, is the `outputs` parameter.

## Usage

All of the default values in filebeat follow the upstream defaults (at the time of writing).

To ship files to [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-configuration-details.html#elasticsearch-output):
```puppet
class { 'filebeat':
  outputs => {
    'elasticsearch' => {
     'hosts' => [
       'http://localhost:9200',
       'http://anotherserver:9200'
     ],
     'index'       => 'packetbeat',
     'cas'         => [
        '/etc/pki/root/ca.pem',
     ],
    },
  },
}

```

To ship log files through [logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-configuration-details.html#logstash-output):
```puppet
class { 'filebeat':
  outputs => {
    'logstash'     => {
     'hosts' => [
       'localhost:5044',
       'anotherserver:5044'
     ],
     'loadbalance' => true,
    },
  },
}

```

[Shipper](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-configuration-details.html#configuration-shipper) and [logging](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-configuration-details.html#configuration-logging) options can be configured the same way, and are documented on the [elastic website](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/index.html).

### Adding a prospector

Prospectors are processes that ship log files to elasticsearch or logstash. They can
be defined as a hash added to the class declaration (also used for automatically creating
prospectors using hiera), or as their own defined resources.

At a minimum, the `paths` parameter must be set to an array of files or blobs that should
be shipped. `doc_type` is what logstash views as the type parameter if you'd like to
apply conditional filters.

```puppet
filebeat::prospector { 'syslogs':
  paths    => [
    '/var/log/auth.log',
    '/var/log/syslog',
  ],
  doc_type => 'syslog-beat',
}
```

#### Multiline Logs

Filebeat prospectors (versions >= 1.1) can handle multiline log entries. The `multiline`
parameter accepts a hash containing `pattern`, `negate`, `match`, `max_lines`, and `timeout`
as documented in the filebeat [configuration documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/1.1/filebeat-configuration-details.html#multiline).

### Prospectors in Hiera

Prospectors can be declared in hiera using the `prospectors` parameter. By default, hiera will not merge
prospector declarations down the hiera hierarchy. To change the behavior in puppet 3 use the `prospectors_merge`
parameter. In puppet 4, you can use `prospectors_merge`, but can also use the
[lookup_options](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/lookup_quick.html#setting-lookupoptions-in-data)
flag.

When `prospectors_merge` is set to true, `prospectors` will be replaced by the output of
`hiera_hash('filebeat::prospectors')`.

### Usage on Windows

When installing on Windows, this module will download the windows version of Filebeat from
[elastic](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat) to `C:\Temp` by default. The directory
can be overridden using the `tmp_dir` parameter. `tmp_dir` is not managed by this module,
but is expected to exist as a directory that puppet can write to.

### Processors

Filebeat 5.0 and greater includes a new libbeat feature for filtering and/or enhancing all
exported data through processors before geing sent to the configured output(s). By populating
the `processors` parameter any number of processors may be configured to work on all events
or only those that match certain conditions.

To drop the offset and input_type fields from all events:

```puppet
class{"filebeat":
  processors => [
    {
      "name" => "drop_fields",
      "params" => ["input_type", "offset"]
    },
  ],
}
```

To drop all events that have the http response code equal to 200:

```puppet
class{"filebeat":
  processors => [
    {
      "name" => "drop_event",
      "when" => {"equals" => {"http.code" => 200}}
    },
  ],
}
```

Now to combine these examples into a single definition:

```puppet
class{"filebeat":
  processors => [
    {
      "name" => "drop_fields",
      "params" => ["input_type", "offset"]
    },
    {
      "name" => "drop_event",
      "when" => {"equals" => {"http.code" => 200}}
    },
  ],
}
```

## Limitations
This module doesn't load the [elasticsearch index template](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-getting-started.html#filebeat-template) into elasticsearch (required when shipping
directly to elasticsearch).

Only filebeat versions after 1.0.0-rc1 are supported. 1.0.0-rc1 and older don't
support YAML like the ruby template can easily generate.

When installing on Windows, there's an expectation that `C:\Temp` already exists, or an alternative
location specified in the `tmp_dir` parameter exists and is writable by puppet. The temp directory
is used to store the downloaded installer only.

### Debian Systems

Filebeat 5.x and newer requires apt-transport-https, but this module won't install it for you.

### Pre-1.9.1 Ruby
If you're on a system running a Ruby pre-1.9.1, hashes aren't sorted consistently, causing puppet runs to
not be idempotent. To fix this, a limited template is used if the rubyversion is pre-1.9.1.
The limited template only supports elasticsearch, logstash, file, and console outputs, and not all options
may be supported (there is no warning when an option is omitted). Unlike with newer rubies, as new versions
of filebeat are released, this template may not work until it's updated, even if you're using an updated
configuration hash.

If you don't care about keeping puppet idempotent, this can be overridden by setting the `conf_template`
parameter to 'filebeat/filebeat.yml.erb'.

See [templates/filebeat.yml.ruby18.erb](https://github.com/pcfens/puppet-filebeat/blob/master/templates/filebeat.yml.ruby18.erb)
for the all of the details.

### Using config_file
There are a few very specific use cases where you don't want this module to directly manage the filebeat
configuration file, but you still want the configuration file on the system at a different location.
Setting `config_file` will write the filebeat configuration file to an alternate location, but it will not
update the init script. If you don't also manage the correct file (/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml on Linux,
C:/Program Files/Filebeat/filebeat.yml on Windows) then filebeat won't be able to start.

If you're copying the alternate config file location into the real location you'll need to include some
metaparameters like
```puppet
file { '/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml':
  ensure  => file,
  source  => 'file:///etc/filebeat/filebeat.special',
  require => File['filebeat.yml'],
  notify  => Service['filebeat'],
}
```
to ensure that services are managed like you might expect.
