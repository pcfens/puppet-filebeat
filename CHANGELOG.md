**Breaking Changes**
- Processors are managed by their own defined resource (slight syntax change) [\#85](https://github.com/pcfens/puppet-filebeat/pull/85)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/pcfens/puppet-filebeat/compare/v0.7.4...v0.8.0)

**Enhancements**
- Add support for Filebeat v5.

If you use this module on a system with filebeat 1.x installed, and you keep your current parameters
nothing will change. Setting `major_version` to '5' will modify the configuration template and update
package repositories, but won't update the package itself. To update the package set the
`package_ensure` parameter to at least 5.0.0.

- Add a parameter `use_generic_template` that uses a more generic version of the configuration
  template. The generic template is more future proof (if types are correct), but looks
  very different than the example file.


## [v0.7.4](https://github.com/pcfens/puppet-filebeat/tree/v0.7.4)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/pcfens/puppet-filebeat/compare/v0.7.2...v0.7.4)

  using `hiera_hash()` [\#25](https://github.com/pcfens/puppet-filebeat/pull/25)
